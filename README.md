This is a library to manage arrays. It is structured as a library so you can import it in your program and use it as you want. The library
contains the following functions:
  - Highest value in the array
  - Lowest value in the array
  - Average value in the array
  - Empty array of certain length

In the future the library will be updated and there will be implemented new functions


Function names:
  - high(array)
      It returns the highest value in the array
  - low(array)
      It returns the lowest value in the array
  - avg(array)
      It returns the average value in the array
  - ema(len)
      It creates an empty array of certain length

NOTE: All the functions before named accept only an array as an argument, except for the "ema" function
